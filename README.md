Fitness Tracker
This is a personal project I worked on because I needed a simple app that could help me manage all my workout and fitness tracking in one place.
The app is built using Flutter and is designed to work across multiple platforms.

Features
- Calorie tracking and daily intake logging
- Weight loss progress monitoring
- Workout tracking with support for logging workout maxes

Motivation
I built this app for my own use after realizing I wanted a single, lightweight tool to track workouts, calories, and progress without switching between multiple apps.

Tech Stack
- Flutter
- Dart
